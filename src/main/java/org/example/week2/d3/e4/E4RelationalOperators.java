// Step 2: Write Relational Comparisons (Ensure the test cases pass)
//   - Compare 'age' with 18 using the greater than or equal operator (>=):
//       Expected: (age >= 18) should output true.
//   - Compare 'temperature' with 35 using the less than operator (<):
//       Expected: (temperature < 35) should output true.
//   - Compare 'score' with 75 using the equality operator (==):
//       Expected: (score == 75) should output true.
//   - Compare 'score' with 100 using the not equal operator (!=):
//       Expected: (score != 100) should output true.
//   - Compare 'age' with 20 using the less than operator (<):
//       Expected: (age < 20) should output true.

// Step 3: Print Each Comparison Result
//   - Use System.out.println to print the result of each relational expression.
//   - Ensure each print statement outputs exactly the boolean value as expected:
