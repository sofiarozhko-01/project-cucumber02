         * 1. Create a String variable called csvLine and assign it the value:
         *    "John Doe,22,Computer Science,3.8,2025"
         *
         * 2. Use the split() method with a comma (",") as the delimiter to break the string into parts.
         *
         * 3. Store the result in a String array.
         *
         * 4. Use a normal for loop to iterate over the array.
         *
         * 5. Print each element on a new line.
         *
         * These steps will help you extract each field from the CSV line and print them one by one.
